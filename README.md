 Hack This Fall strives to harness the power of technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation for the betterment of society.

# My Process
Hack This Fall's Open Track theme is "Innovate for Good". For this hackathon, I am going to think about the project in these 3 steps.
1. Define Problem Statement
2. Ideate Solutions
3. Prototype

## Defining a Problem Statement
As a prior teacher, I struggled with feeling supported in the classroom. Nothing can replace in-person support - whether that is talking with colleagues, having a mentor, seeing other teachers work, etc. However, can I prototype something that can help support teachers?

## Ideating Solutions
With that in mind, I might have liked a single site where teachers can discuss their experiences, share helpful resources, and not feel alone. 
- Reddit and other social media sites allow teachers to discuss their situations and get advice from experienced teachers. 
- TeachersPayTeachers allow teachers to share their resources with one another for all grade levels.
- Individual teachers write their own blogs with so much amazing information and tips. 

I want to create a prototype for a site that consolidates these different pieces into a single place. 

## Prototype
My prototype will be a Website using React.

I created my design on Figma which can be seen here:
